  Each Chinese character can be deconstructed into 
  = link_to("radicals", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radical") + "." 
  Normal dictionaries only use one radical for each character. This made sense a few centuries ago, but I want to take it one step further by breaking each character down into multiple radicals. This will make it easier to identify a character if you see one in the real world.
